# Challenge 3

## Approach problem summary

My initial thoughts in solving this problem is to use a web app since a web app can run on any platform that has a browser. Then, I'll look for a web stack that meets the basic requirements. Since any stack will be able to meet those requirements, I decided to use the one that you listed as Bonus in the job listing for Software Engineer (Full Stack) - Full Time: Python/Flask + REST APIs + ReactJS Frontend.

## Written notes of the solution

## Installation

* The script can run on any OS(Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.) with Python 3.* installed.

### Install dependencies backend

Recommended: Install these packages in a python3.6 virtual environment.

```bash
pip install flask
pip install sqlite3
pip install json
```

### Install dependencies frontend

Recommended: Install these packages in a python3.6 virtual environment.

```bash
pip install flask
pip install sqlite3
pip install json
```

## Usage

In order to start the backend, run the following script assuming you are on a Unix platform:

```bash
cd ~/worktest/challenge_3/backend
python app.py
```

In order to start the frontend, run the following script assuming you are on a Unix platform:

```bash
cd ~/worktest/challenge_3/frontend
python script.py
```
