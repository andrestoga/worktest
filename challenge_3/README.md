# Challenge 3

## Approach problem summary

My initial thoughts in solving this problem is to look for a web stack that meets the basic requirements. Since any stack will be able to meet those requirements, I decided to use the one that you listed as Bonus in the job listing for Software Engineer (Full Stack) - Full Time: Python/Flask.
