# Challenge 1

## Approach problem summary

My initial thoughts in solving this problem is to use the circle parametric equations to relate a x and y point in the circunference of the circle to the distance measured by the piston using the Euclidean distance. The circle is created by the rotation of the wheel.

## Written notes of the solution

The following three images describe the calculations I come up with the equation to calculate the theta angle.
